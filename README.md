# ToDo-List-App

## Setup
1. To get this repository, run the following command inside your git-enabled terminal
```
$ git clone https://github.com/RadhaTawar/ToDo-List-App.git
```
2. Open Terminal:
Open your terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to Project Folder:
Use the cd command to navigate to your project folder. For example:
```
cd/ todo-list-app
```
3. Start a Local Server:
If you have Python installed, you can start a simple HTTP server using the following command:
```
$ python -m http.server
```
This command starts a server on http://localhost:8000 (or a different port if 8000 is in use).
If you have Node.js installed, you can use the http-server package. Install it globally (if not installed) and run the server:
```
$ npm install -g http-server
$ http-server
```
Alternatively, if you're using Visual Studio Code, you can install the "Live Server" extension and use it to launch your project.

4. Open in Browser:
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000 (or the port your server is running on).
